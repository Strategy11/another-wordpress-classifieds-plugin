If you love the plugin, [please consider purchasing a Premium Module](https://awpcp.com/premium-modules/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion)!

== Installation ==

= IMPORTANT =

Please backup your WordPress database before you install/uninstall/activate/deactivate/upgrade Another WordPress Classifieds Plugin.

Pre-installation note: If you have previously tried other classified plugins and you plan to give the classifieds page created by Another WordPress Classifieds Plugin the same name as previously used with other classifieds plugins you've installed, please make sure your database has been cleared of any entries in the wp_posts table where the post_name value and the post_title value are the same as the name you plan to give your classifieds page.
For example, if your classifieds page will be named "Classifieds", you might have a wp_posts database entry post_title value of "Classifieds" and post_name value of "classifieds" still left over from previous installations of other classifieds plugins.
You need to check your database to make sure data from your previous classifieds plugins does not still exist. Specifically, you need to delete all entries from your wp_posts table where the post_title and post_name values are the same as what you plan to name your classifieds page.

1. 	Upload the folder another-wordpress-classifieds-plugin with its contents to wp-content/plugins/
2. Activate the plugin
3.	Click on the "Click here to setup your site options" link and fill out all your various options to configure how you want your classifieds to run.
4. 	After you have setup your options you should create some categories and sub categories for your classifieds
5. 	After you have created your categories you should setup your payment fees if you are going to be running in pay mode.

Your classifieds should now be ready and working.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

For the definitive FAQ section, please visit the [FAQ Section of the Forum]( https://awpcp.com/forum/faq/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion), or our [Quick Start](https://awpcp.com/quick-start-guide/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) guide.

= How do I install Another WP Classifieds Plugin? =
Please see our [Installation Guide](https://awpcp.com/quick-start-guide/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion#qs-general), the [Quick Start Guide](https://awpcp.com/quick-start-guide/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) for common how-to scenarios, and our [Initial Setup](https://awpcp.com/documentation/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion#setup) page for instructions on how to get going quickly with Business Directory Plugin.

Full [documentation](https://awpcp.com/docs/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) for the plugin is also available.

= What types of classified listings directories can I create? =

Our classifieds website builder software combined with our add-on modules is the most powerful classifieds plugin on the market. The options for classified advertising are limitless. Here are a few types of classified directories you can create:

* Job board listings and help wanted
* Auto, truck, and car listings
* Apartment classifieds
* Property and real estate listings
* Dating and personal listings
* Fashion listings to buy and sell clothing
* Announcements for events like yard sales, reunions, auctions, and school events

= Can AWPCP support paid and free listings? =
Yes it can. You can do this by creating fee plans for 0.00 and some other paid amount at the same time. For more details, read [this article](https://awpcp.com/quick-start-guide/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion#qs-freepaid).

= Will AWPCP work with my theme? =
AWPCP will work with any well-written, WP compliant theme. Generally speaking, paid themes tend to be higher quality than free ones.

In general, we like WooThemes as a solid company with great products and support. You can check them out [here](http://woothemes.com) Or [StudioPress](http://studiopress.com​​)

= Can AWPCP be translated into my language? =
Yes it can. AWPCP comes with many user-provided translations under the /languages folder. For details on how to do it, our [translation guide](https://awpcp.com/quick-start-guide/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion#qs-translate) will help get you started.

= Is AWPCP compatible with WordPress Multisite (WPMU)? =
Yes it is. However, you cannot "network-activate" the plugin (as this will share the database). Activate it on only the subsites on which you need a directory. This can be done under Plugins->Add New as the Administrator user. Do not "network activate" AWPCP as the "super admin".
